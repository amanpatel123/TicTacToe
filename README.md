# TicTacToe

This is a very basic code which I tried designing in an complete Object Oriented way. I created a simple Tic-Tac-toe game which allows two user to play against each other. Interestingly the two players can be Human vs Human Or Human vs AI. 

The complete code is created in Java. I am working on developing the same game with more features and more smart AI player using python I will be uploading that soon. 

Till then Enjoy playing this console base game with your friend...
